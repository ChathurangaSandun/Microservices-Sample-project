# ASPNETCoreDockerMicroservices
Sample project for getting off the ground with ASP.NET Core, Docker and Microservices based on the tutorial: https://fullstackmark.com/post/12/get-started-building-microservices-with-asp.net-core-and-docker-in-visual-studio-code

This repo contains the demo project used as the subject for a blog post I did on getting started with ASP.NET Core-based microservices and Docker.  If you just want to run the project please follow instructions below.  If you'd like to learn more on how it was built please check out this [detailed guide on my blog](https://fullstackmark.com/post/12/get-started-building-microservices-with-asp.net-core-and-docker-in-visual-studio-code).


# Environment
It should be fairly cross-platform friendly to get up and running but was developed on my windows 10 machine along with the following:

- Visual Studio Code - v1.19.0
    - C# for Visual Studio Code extension
    - Docker extension
 - SQL Server Management Studio 17.4
